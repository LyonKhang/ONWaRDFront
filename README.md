ONWaRD is short for Online Network for Writing and Retrieving Data. This is a REST API service built with the Spring Boot framework that allows a platform where companies can electronically manage all their data, enabling them to go paperless. <br/>
This application demonstrates how to utilize Microsoft .NET Maui Framework, Spring Boot application, and Project Lombok to work together  to create an innovative product. <br/>
 <br/> This is a front end part <br/>

## _Requirements_


* Having Microsoft .NET Maui Framework for the Front end. <br>
  Install **Microsoft .NET Maui Framework 8.0.3** from [Microsoft's website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

  Having Android SDK platform  by Xamarin. Follow the step in [Microsoft's website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk?tabs=windows).


  
## _Installation_

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using this
   command: <br/> `git clone https://github.com/LyonKhang/onward.git`
2. Import the project into your IDE (such as Eclipse or Visual Studio code).
3. start the application from OnwardApplication.java
4. Run the application as a Spring Boot application (usually located in your IDE), or use the Maven plugin `mvn spring-boot:run`.
5. Go to localhost:8080/ on your web browser.

*Try adding endpoints with simple text and stuff, 
follow the template for greeting and add endpoint methods to DemoController,
just make sure you do it in the form @GetMapping("/YOURTEXTHERE")
The first slash is important

## _Architecture_

Frontend
* Microsoft .NET MAUI Framework: Our choice for the frontend to create a responsive and interactive user interface that operates across different platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) with a single codebase.
* C# and XAML: The primary languages used for development, where C# provides the logic and XAML defines the UI layout and design. This combination ensures a powerful yet flexible way to build our appâ€™s interface.

Development Environment
* Visual Studio : The main Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for the project, Mianly devleopd for hightly focus gcc..NET Extension Pack, and more for comprehensive development support.

Integration and Data Management
* JSON: Standard format for data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring compatibility and ease of data manipulation.
